# Homebrew for Lyra

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for Lyra Project builds.

## How do I install these packages?

This repo follows an implicit magic naming scheme that Homebrew uses. The brew tools will automatically search
github.com/_username_/homebrew-_project_/_package_ when installing, so you can simply use:

```
brew cask install lyraproj/lyra/lyra
```

To get the Cask (pre-built binary) version of Lyra itself.
